# Error Logging Improvements Ideas for Mac Mouse Fix (October 2024)

> [!NOTE]
> This repo is just a note to jot down my ideas. Not sure why I'm creating a GitHub repo for this instead of just an Apple Note or something. I hope It's not a terrible idea to make 'Note Taking Repos'. Might be bad that we can't sort / filter them if we create a lot of different ones?

Update: [Apr 2025] Moved content to [notes-public](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/notes-public/blob/0269b2323a773e2d29044b52e123632a7c57490e/folders/mmf/error-logging-improvement-ideas_oct-2024.md) (The Note Taking Repo thing seemed to work decently for this, not we're seeing if we can move all our notes into git repos.)
